#### Flexbox

* Flexbox is an efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a **container**.
* Is used when items/elements size is unknown and/or dynamic (flexible).
* Is a 1-dimensional system.
* **Flexbox** layout is most appropriate to the components of an application, and small-scale layouts.
* **Grid** layout is intended for larger scale layouts.
